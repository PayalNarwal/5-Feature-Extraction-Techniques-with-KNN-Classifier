# 5-Feature-Extraction-Techniques-with-KNN-Classifier

This repository demonstrates face recognition using various **feature extraction techniques** with a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier** on the **AT&T (ORL) dataset**. We implement and compare feature extraction methods including:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **Local Binary Patterns Histogram (LBPH)**
- **FaceNet**
- **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)**

The dataset is split into:
- **60% for training**
- **20% for validation**
- **20% for testing**

The performance of each method is evaluated using four metrics:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1 Score**

This project serves as a comparative study of these feature extraction techniques, demonstrating their strengths and weaknesses when applied to the KNN classifier for face recognition tasks.
